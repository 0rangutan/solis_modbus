# Solis Modbus Integration for Home Assistant

## Description

The Solis S6 Modbus Integration for Home Assistant is a streamlined solution to connect your Solis S6 inverter with Home Assistant. This integration was inspired by [fboundy's ha_solis_modbus](https://github.com/fboundy/ha_solis_modbus/tree/main). However, it enhances the native Modbus integration in Home Assistant by consolidating multiple register queries into single calls, eliminating unnecessary overhead.

## Installation

1. Open your Home Assistant instance.
